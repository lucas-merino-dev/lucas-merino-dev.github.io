## Overview
  This is my first time completing a challenge from Frontend Mentor and I really enjoyed it and learned A LOT with this process.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

  I had some real trouble on first time trying this challenge, it really got in my mind... But I gave it another chance and really enjoyed it
on my second try, being able to learn new stuff and improve my HTML and CSS skills.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

  In this project I had the opportunity to use the selector nth-child(x) for the first time, which was completely useful to create the colored
boxes on the right.

  Also, this project really helped me with semantic and line of thought, making my head less messy.

### Continued development

  I intend to continue my studies in CSS and HTML in order to become a real frontend dev, still not fully comfortable with all the tools that
we get to use with these two, but trying my best and learning everyday!
